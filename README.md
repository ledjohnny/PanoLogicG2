# PanoLogicG2
Generic repository for Pano Logic G2 experimenting

## BreakOut Board (BOB)
This idea was inspired by [twj42](https://github.com/twj42/PanoLogicG2_ReverseEngineering/blob/master/pages/bob.md) who came up a great idea to get access to some of the pins on the Xilinx Spartan-6 of the Pano Logic G2.

The files that I created while building the BOB can be found under the BOB/ directory.
